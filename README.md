# DAECli-Batches-and-Shortcuts

Here's the first version of DAE-CLI semi interface for Windows.

What this program does?
This utility will generate a folder inside your documents containing the batch files and icons. On your desktop you will have a folder that contains the shortcuts in where you can just drag and drop images onto them to create said style.

Requirements?
On my machine Windows 10 pro 64 bits english with a registered version of Deep Art Effects works fine. There shouldn't be any issues with any version of Windows 10.

How to install?
Click on top the green button Code - Download zip
Extract the zip file you have downloaded from this project (No specific location requried)
Once extracted find the setup.bat file and right click properties and unlock it (Unless you are like me and use OOShutup then you will need to do this)
once done double click on setup.bat what this will do it will create custom batch files setup for your computer configuration and create a folder of shortcuts on the desktop (In which afterwards you can move, delete, keep what you want) to drag your images onto.

What to expect?
When taking for example style alice dragging picture cat_.png would create cat_alice.png the output image can then be dragged to another style to add more effects to your image.

I need more help? I found a bug or I think we can add or improve upon?
forum.deeparteffects.com under the github post I'll gladly answer all questions there.

How to uninstall?
That's easy just delete the folder called DAECLI from your documents and remove the DAE-CLI from your desktop.

Like anything in this world this program is offered as-is read the files don't be shy to ask questions about it one should never fully trust a program 100% every machine is different. Good luck and have fun.


Icons we're generated based on Images owned by (c)Deep Art Effects for interface Fair Use to help the community grow as for everything else here the code is free to use for whatever you want.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON THIS BUILD THE DEEPARTEFFECTSCLI.EXE NEEDS TO BE INSIDE SOMEWHERE IN THE C:\USERS (Could be on your desktop) I will figure out a way to scan all the drives or give you a variable option to enter your own path for now if the Deeparteffectscli.exe is not in the path of c:\users the installation will stop.

If you encounter an issue with Defender stopping you from editing or running setup.bat, you need to unblock it. Right-click, Select Properties and Check "Unblock" under security. See below.
